To build cd into this directory and use:

./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install


Or you can run the app direct by using ./Perms/app/perms
A debug version is built in the folder ./Perms/debug


You can supply arguments to autogen.sh which will be passed to the configure script ie:
./autogen.sh --prefix=/some/other/installation/folder

You will need automake 1.9
